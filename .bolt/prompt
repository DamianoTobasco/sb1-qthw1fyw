I'm building a calorie + water tracker, meditation, habit tracker, and workout fitness logging app. It's called Evolve, this app is an all in one hub for health. users can track calories to improve weight goals. or track habits based on their wishes to see how they've been improving and how long they've committed to a habit. Users can workout log their workouts so later date can come back and reference what they did. this app also will provide AI food detection scan in order to track calories similar to Cal.AI.
